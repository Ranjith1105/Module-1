## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Finding the Minimum of Three Float Numbers Using the Ternary Operator 

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the minimum among three float numbers using the conditional expression (ternary operator)
## ALGORITHM  
1.Begin the program.
2.Use the eval() function to read three float numbers from the user.
3.Print the float numbers entered by the user.
4.Use nested conditional (ternary) expressions to find the smallest number.
5.Print the minimum number.
6.Terminate the program.
## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No - 212223020021
# Name- Ranjith P
# Write your code here

a=eval(input())
b=eval(input())
c=eval(input())
d=min(a,b,c)
print(f'The minimum of {a}, {b}, {c} is {d}')

```
