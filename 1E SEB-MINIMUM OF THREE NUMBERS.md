# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Check Traffic Condition Based on Road Coverage Using If-Else 

## AIM  
To write a Python program to determine traffic status based on the fraction of roadways covered using conditional statements.
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.
2.Use the eval() function to read the traffic fraction from the user.
3.Check the value of traffic_fraction using conditional statements.
4.Print the corresponding traffic status.
5.Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212223020021
# Name- Ranjith P
# Write your code here

a=eval(input())
if a>0.5:
    print('High Traffic!')
elif a>0.25 and a<=0.5:
    print('Medium Traffic')
else:
    print('Low Traffic')
```
