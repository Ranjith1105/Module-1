# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - for Basic Arithmetic Operations 

## AIM
To write a Python program to read two integers and perform simple arithmetic calculations (+, -, *, /, //, %, **), using the eval() function.
## ALGORITHM
1.Begin the program.
2.Use the eval() function to read two integers from the user.
3.Print the integers entered by the user.
4.Perform the following arithmetic operations on the integers:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Floor Division (//)
Modulus (%)
Exponentiation (**)
5.Print the results of each operation.
6.Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No - 212223020021
#Name - Ranjith P
#Write your code here
a=eval(input())
b=eval(input())
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a//b)
print(a%b)
print(a**b)

```
